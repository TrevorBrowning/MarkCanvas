## Instructions

1.  **Make the Bolognese:** Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until softened. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Drain excess fat. Stir in crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for at least 20 minutes.
2.  **Make the Béchamel:** In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk until smooth. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in nutmeg.
